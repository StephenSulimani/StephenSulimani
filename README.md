Hi, I'm Stephen, a fourth-year Computer Science student at the University of Georgia! I am currently interested in learning about Finance, Financial Technology, and Machine Learning.
I will be graduating in December of 2025 and I'm looking for entry level software engineering or financial technology positions in or around New York and Atlanta.
Please contact me @ [biz@suli.nyc](mailto:biz@suli.nyc)
