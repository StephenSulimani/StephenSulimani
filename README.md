Hi, I'm Stephen, a fourth-year Computer Science student at the University of Georgia! I am currently interested in learning about Finance, Financial Technology, and Machine Learning.
I'm looking for software engineering or financial technology internships to explore the industry and develop experience by collaborating on real-world projects.
